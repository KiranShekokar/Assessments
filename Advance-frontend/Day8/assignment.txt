1) Different types of selectors in css : 
 a)combinators - >, (Space) , + , ~
 b)pseudo class selectors -> : => hover,link,active etc
 c) pseudo elements selectors => :: =>selection , first-letter , first-line
 d) simple selector - using classname , id , tagname
 e) attribute selector - to select elements with a specified attribute or attribute value
  example: a[target]{  <!--can also by written as a[target=_blank]{}
    color:red;
  }
  <a href="#" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

2) CDN: when used first time it takes from the server & saves it in the temporary storage of browser thus need
 not to call the server again and again.

3) difference between "this" & $(this) -> both refers to the same element , "this" normal notation=>it is a keyword,used as this.innerText = "hey" ;
  $(this)=>got the power of jQuery, it has become jquery object,used as $(this).text("hey");

4)Use of $(document).ready() => ready occurs when dom has been loaded.
 this prevents any jQuery code to run before dom loading
 the main motive of this statement is the execution of jQuery code after the dom is loaded.
 when script tag is in the middle of the code then if $(document).ready() is not used then the execution will be as per the order of the code , but if $(document).ready() is used then jquery code will work only when the dom is loaded irrespective of the position of the script tag.

 function=> which we need to perform.

7) to select all textboxes => $(input[type=text]).event(function())
